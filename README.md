### Hi, I'm Javier Kadjo! ðŸ‘‹

A year ago, I ventured into software development, and over time, I found myself becoming enthusiastic about data analysis.

## About Me

Since the beginning of my journey in development, I've enjoyed crafting interactive, appealing, and effective interfaces. I embarked on my path in the Front-end world, utilizing JavaScript as my primary tool. As I gained experience, I explored the React.js library, enabling me to apply and learn tools to construct more dynamic and efficient web applications.

By mid-2023, I've immersed myself in data analysis using Python, Power BI, and SQL, allowing me to further understand the field and harness data-driven insights for informed decision-making.
